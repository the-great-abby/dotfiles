# Unified System Workflow: Zettelkasten + GTD + Second Brain

## 🎯 The Big Picture

You have three powerful systems that work together:

1. **Zettelkasten** = Atomic ideas (one concept per note, linked together)
2. **GTD** = Action workflow (tasks, projects, getting things done)
3. **Second Brain** = Knowledge organization (PARA, progressive summarization, content creation)

**The key insight**: They're not separate systems—they're different layers of the same knowledge and productivity system.

## 🧠 The Mental Model

Think of your system as a pyramid:

```
        EXPRESS (Second Brain)
       Create content, publish
    ────────────────────────────
         ORGANIZE (Second Brain)
    PARA, MOCs, Evergreen Notes
    ────────────────────────────
         BUILD (Zettelkasten)
    Atomic notes, connections
    ────────────────────────────
         ACT (GTD)
    Tasks, projects, actions
    ────────────────────────────
         CAPTURE (All Systems)
    Quick capture to inbox
```

## 📋 Decision Tree: What Goes Where?

### When You Have Something to Capture

```
Is it actionable?
├─ YES → Is it a single task?
│   ├─ YES → GTD Capture (task)
│   └─ NO → GTD Capture (project)
│
└─ NO → Is it an atomic idea/concept?
    ├─ YES → Zettelkasten (zet)
    └─ NO → Is it reference material?
        ├─ YES → GTD Capture (reference) → Second Brain (Resources)
        └─ NO → GTD Capture (note) → Process later
```

### When Processing Your Inboxes

```
GTD Inbox Item:
├─ Actionable? → GTD Process (create task/project)
└─ Reference? → Second Brain (Resources)

Zettelkasten Inbox:
├─ Atomic idea? → Keep as Zettelkasten note
├─ Part of larger concept? → Link to Second Brain note
└─ Actionable insight? → Create GTD task/project
```

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

## 🔗 Linking Strategy

### The Linking Hierarchy

```
GTD Project
    ↓
Second Brain Project Note
    ↓
MOC (Map of Content)
    ↓
Zettelkasten Notes (Atomic Ideas)
    ↓
GTD Tasks (Actions)
```

### Practical Linking Rules

1. **Zettelkasten → Zettelkasten**: Link related atomic concepts
2. **Zettelkasten → Second Brain**: Link atomic notes to larger resources/projects
3. **Second Brain → GTD**: Link resources to actionable projects
4. **GTD → Second Brain**: Auto-sync projects/areas to Second Brain
5. **All → All**: Use bidirectional linking when it makes sense

   └─ Link everything together

3. ORGANIZE (Second Brain)
   ├─ PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
   ├─ MOCs (Maps of Content)
   └─ Progressive summarization

4. ACT (GTD)
   ├─ Work from tasks
   ├─ Complete projects
   └─ Review regularly

## 🎨 The Art of the System

Remember: **The system serves you, not the other way around.**

- **Capture liberally** - Get everything out of your head
- **Process regularly** - Don't let inboxes pile up
- **Organize thoughtfully** - But don't overthink it
- **Link meaningfully** - Build connections that matter
- **Review consistently** - Keep the system fresh

The magic happens when these systems work together:
- **Zettelkasten** captures and connects ideas
- **GTD** turns ideas into action
- **Second Brain** organizes and expresses knowledge

Together, they create a complete system for thinking, doing, and creating.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I have too many notes in my inbox"
→ Process more regularly. Set a daily reminder.

### "I don't know where to put something"
→ Put it in an inbox. Process it later. Don't overthink capture.

### "My notes aren't connected"
→ Use the discovery tools: `gtd-brain-discover connections`
→ Link notes during weekly review

### "I'm not using the system"
→ Start with just capture. Build the habit first.
→ Use the wizard - it guides you through everything.

## 🎉 Success Metrics

You'll know the system is working when:

1. ✅ Your inboxes are regularly processed
2. ✅ You can find information quickly
3. ✅ Ideas flow from capture to action
4. ✅ You're creating content from your notes
5. ✅ The system feels natural, not burdensome

Remember: **A good system is one you actually use.** Start simple, build complexity gradually, and let the system evolve with your needs.
