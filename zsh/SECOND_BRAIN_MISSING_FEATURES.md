# Missing Second Brain Features - Implementation Guide

Based on Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain methodology, here's what you're missing and how to implement it.

## ✅ What You Have

- **PARA Method** - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
- **Progressive Summarization** - 3-level system
- **Bidirectional Linking** - GTD ↔ Second Brain
- **Knowledge Discovery** - Finding connections
- **Automatic Syncing** - GTD and Second Brain stay in sync

## ❌ What You're Missing

### 1. **CODE Method** (Complete Framework)
You have **Capture** and **Organize**, but missing explicit **Distill** and **Express** phases.

**CODE stands for:**
- **C**apture - ✅ You have this (gtd-capture)
- **O**rganize - ✅ You have this (PARA method)
- **D**istill - ⚠️ Partial (progressive summarization exists but not as explicit workflow)
- **E**xpress - ❌ Missing (creating/sharing from notes)

### 2. **MOCs (Maps of Content)**
Index notes that organize related notes by topic. Like a table of contents for your knowledge.

**Example:**
- `MOC - Productivity.md` - Links to all productivity-related notes
- `MOC - Kubernetes.md` - Links to all K8s learning notes

### 3. **Intermediate Packets**
Reusable components of work that can be assembled into larger projects.

**Example:**
- A "meeting notes template" packet
- A "project kickoff checklist" packet
- A "weekly review template" packet

### 4. **Express Phase**
The final step: creating and sharing from your notes.

**Missing:**
- Creating content from notes (blog posts, presentations, etc.)
- Sharing insights
- Publishing from Second Brain

### 5. **Project Checklists**
Templates for project kickoff and management.

**Missing:**
- Project kickoff checklist
- Project review checklist
- Project completion checklist

### 6. **Evergreen Notes**
Notes that grow in value over time through continuous refinement.

**Missing:**
- Identification of evergreen notes
- Refinement workflow
- Connection building for evergreen notes

### 7. **Divergence/Convergence**
Two-phase thinking process:
- **Divergence**: Generate many ideas (brainstorming)
- **Convergence**: Narrow down to best ideas (decision-making)

### 8. **Weekly Review with Second Brain**
Reviewing Second Brain notes as part of weekly GTD review.

**Missing:**
- Second Brain review questions
- Note refinement during review
- Connection discovery during review

### 9. **Notetaking Templates**
Structured templates for different note types.

**Missing:**
- Meeting notes template
- Book notes template
- Article notes template
- Project notes template
- Area notes template

### 10. **Connection Notes**
Explicit notes that connect ideas across topics.

**Missing:**
- Creating connection notes
- Identifying when to create them
- Templates for connection notes

## 🎯 Priority Implementation Order

### High Priority (Core Methodology)

1. **MOCs (Maps of Content)** - Essential for navigation
2. **Express Phase** - Complete the CODE cycle
3. **Weekly Review Integration** - Connect GTD and Second Brain reviews
4. **Notetaking Templates** - Improve note quality

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)

5. **Intermediate Packets** - Reusable components
6. **Project Checklists** - Better project management
7. **Evergreen Notes** - Long-term knowledge building

### Lower Priority (Advanced)

8. **Divergence/Convergence** - Advanced thinking process
9. **Connection Notes** - Explicit idea connections
10. **Enhanced Distill Phase** - More explicit workflow

## 📋 Implementation Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Can implement now)

1. **Create MOC templates** - Add to Second Brain
2. **Add Express commands** - Create content from notes
3. **Add templates directory** - For note templates
4. **Enhance weekly review** - Include Second Brain review

### Medium Effort

5. **Intermediate Packets system** - Create packet management
6. **Project checklists** - Add to gtd-project
7. **Evergreen notes identification** - Add to gtd-brain

### Advanced Features

8. **Divergence/Convergence tools** - Brainstorming workflows
9. **Connection note creation** - Automated connection detection
10. **Enhanced Express phase** - Publishing workflows

## 💡 Next Steps

Would you like me to implement:
1. **MOCs system** - Create MOC management commands
2. **Express phase** - Commands for creating/sharing from notes
3. **Templates** - Note templates for different types
4. **Weekly Review Enhancement** - Integrate Second Brain into reviews
5. **All of the above** - Complete Second Brain implementation
