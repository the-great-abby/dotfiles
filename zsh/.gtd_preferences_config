# GTD Preferences Config
# Manual overrides for learned preferences
# This file allows you to manually set preferences that override what the system learns from your behavior

# Preferred contexts (override learned preferences)
# Format: context=preference_score (0.0-1.0)
# Higher scores mean more preferred. Example:
# computer=0.8
# home=0.6
# office=0.4

# Priority calibration (override learned patterns)
# Adjust how often you use each priority level
# Format: priority_<level>=frequency (0.0-1.0)
# Example: If you rarely use "urgent_important", set:
# priority_urgent_important=0.1  # Only 10% of tasks should be urgent_important
# priority_not_urgent_important=0.7  # 70% should be not urgent but important

# Feature usage preferences
# Disable suggestions for features you never use
# Format: disable_suggestions_for=<feature_name>
# Example:
# disable_suggestions_for=habits
# disable_suggestions_for=zettelkasten

# Review timing preferences (override learned times)
# Set your preferred review times regardless of when you actually do them
# Format: preferred_<type>_review_<setting>=<value>
# Example:
# preferred_daily_review_time=18:00
# preferred_weekly_review_day=Sunday
# preferred_weekly_review_time=09:00

# Writing style preferences
# Adjust how AI suggests task titles and descriptions
# Example:
# prefer_concise_titles=true
# prefer_action_verbs=true
# max_title_length=60

# Context preferences (manual override)
# Force certain contexts for certain task types
# Format: context_for_<keyword>=<context>
# Example:
# context_for_email=computer
# context_for_call=phone
# context_for_meeting=office
