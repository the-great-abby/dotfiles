# ✅ Alias Conflicts - Resolved

## 🔍 What I Found

### Conflict Found:
- **`l`** is already aliased to `ls -lah` by Oh My Zsh (from `directories.zsh`)
- This is a common, useful alias for listing files

### No Conflicts:
- `p`, `t`, `w`, `c`, `i` - Not defined by Oh My Zsh with only `git` plugin enabled

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Protected all single-letter aliases** - Now checks if they exist before setting
2. **Kept `l` as listing** - Since it's already set to `ls -lah`, we won't override it
3. **Use `log` for logging** - More explicit and doesn't conflict

## 📋 Current Alias Status

| Alias | Value | Source | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| `l` | `ls -lah` | Oh My Zsh | ✅ Kept (useful for listing) |
| `log` | `addInfoToDailyLog` | GTD | ✅ Use this for logging |
| `p` | `gtd-process` | GTD | ✅ Set (no conflict) |
| `t` | `gtd-task list` | GTD | ✅ Set (no conflict) |
| `w` | `make gtd-wizard` | GTD | ✅ Set (no conflict) |
| `c` | `gtd-c` | GTD | ✅ Set (no conflict) |
| `i` | `gtd-i` | GTD | ✅ Set (no conflict) |

## 💡 Usage

**For logging, use:**
```bash
log "my log entry"    # ✅ Works - explicit and clear
```

**For listing files, use:**
```bash
l                     # ✅ Works - shows ls -lah
ll                    # Also available (if Oh My Zsh sets it)
```

**All other aliases work as expected:**
```bash
c "task"              # ✅ Capture
p                     # ✅ Process inbox
t                     # ✅ List tasks
w                     # ✅ Open wizard
i "idea"              # ✅ Capture idea
```

## 🎯 Summary

- ✅ All conflicts resolved
- ✅ Protected against future conflicts
- ✅ `l` kept for listing (use `log` for logging)
- ✅ Everything else works perfectly!
