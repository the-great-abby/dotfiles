## 🎯 How to Decide Which Areas You Need

### Questions to Ask Yourself:

1. **Is this ongoing?**
   - Areas are ongoing responsibilities, not one-time projects
   - If it has an end date, it's probably a project

2. **Does it need regular attention?**
   - Areas require maintenance and regular review
   - If you can ignore it for months, it might not be an area

3. **Is it important to me?**
   - Only create areas for things that matter to you
   - Don't create areas just because they exist

4. **Does it overlap with existing areas?**
   - Check if it fits into an existing area first
   - Only create new area if it's distinct enough

5. **Can I maintain it?**
   - Be realistic about how many areas you can track
   - Start with fewer areas and add more as needed

## 📊 Area Overlap Considerations

### Common Overlaps:

**Health & Wellness vs. Fitness & Sports:**
- Health & Wellness: General health, medication, nutrition
- Fitness & Sports: Specific athletic pursuits, sports training

**Relationships vs. Family & Extended Family:**
- Relationships: All relationships (friends, partner, family)
- Family & Extended Family: Specifically family relationships

**Personal Development vs. Learning & Education:**
- Personal Development: General growth and self-improvement
- Learning & Education: Formal learning, courses, certifications

**Community & Giving vs. Volunteering & Service:**
- Community & Giving: General giving and community involvement
- Volunteering & Service: Specific volunteer commitments

**Recommendation:** Start with broader areas, then split if needed.
