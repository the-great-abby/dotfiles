# Life Vision Discovery Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Not everyone has a clear life plan or vision—and that's completely okay! This guide helps you discover what matters to you and create a vision for your life, even if you're starting from scratch.

## 💭 Why Life Vision Matters

A life vision isn't about having everything figured out. It's about:
- **Direction**: Knowing roughly where you want to go
- **Priorities**: Understanding what matters most to you
- **Decisions**: Having a framework for making choices
- **Motivation**: Having something to work toward

But remember: **Your vision can change!** It's not set in stone.

## 🔍 Step 1: Start with What You Know

### What Are You Already Doing?

Even without a formal plan, you're already living your life. Start by observing:

#### Questions to Ask Yourself:
1. **What do you spend your time on?**
   - Review your daily logs
   - Look at your calendar
   - Check your projects and tasks
   - What patterns do you see?

2. **What makes you feel good?**
   - When do you feel energized?
   - What activities bring you joy?
   - What makes you feel accomplished?

3. **What do you complain about?**

   - What would you change if you could?
   - What's missing from your life?

4. **What are you naturally good at?**
   - What comes easily to you?
   - What do people ask you for help with?
   - What skills do you have?

### Use Your GTD System

```bash
# Review your daily logs for patterns

**Look for:**

### Vision Statement Template

**Even if it's vague, write something:**

```
In [timeframe], I want to be someone who:
- [Character trait or value]
- [What you're doing]
- [How you're contributing]

I want my life to include:
- [Important element 1]
- [Important element 2]
- [Important element 3]

I want to feel:
- [Feeling 1]
- [Feeling 2]
```

**Example (even if vague):**
```
In 3 years, I want to be someone who:
- Is healthy and active
- Is learning and growing
- Is making a positive impact

I want my life to include:
- Good relationships
