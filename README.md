That's a sunset, and these are my personal dotfiles for various Unix utilities.
On the off chance you find any of these files useful, you are free to use or
adapt them however you see fit. Honey badger don't care.

### Installation

#### Windows / Powershell

#### Linux / Mac

No longer valid ...
1. Run <code>bootstrap.sh</code> to link the files into your home directory.

2. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqw4wo8vdY8

3. ???

4. Et voil√†!

### Additional Notes

1) git submodule init

2) git submodule update

3) run vim

4) :BundleInstall (hopefully this works, running into difficulty when I try on
my other machine)

### TODO

1) Move Emacs to this dotfiles installation

2) Add it so it automaically initiallizes the submodules for everything

(that would probably go into bootstrap.sh or something ...)
